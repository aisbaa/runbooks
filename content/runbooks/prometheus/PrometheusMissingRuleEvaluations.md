# PrometheusMissingRuleEvaluations

## Meaning

Alert fires when prometheus rule_group evaluation takes consistently longer than rule_group interval.

## Impact

Rule groups have either alerts or recording rules. If prometheus can not evaluate rules in time - it might fail to trigger alert.

## Diagnosis

Quick checks:
- Check if enough resources allocated to promeheus.
- Check if there are no bad neighbors that consume too much CPU.

Deep dive:
- Use `prometheus_rule_group_iterations_missed_total` metric to identify strugling rule_group.

## Mitigation

Quick fixes:
- Increase CPU resources allocation to prometheus.
- Movebad neighbor to different host.

Deep dive:
- Increase rule evaluate interval.
- Splitup up rule_group into smaller groups if rules do not depend on each other. It should help because rules inside a group are evaluated in sequence.
